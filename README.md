## **Experiment 1: Designing UI Using Bootstrap Components**

### **Aim**
To design a responsive user interface using a component library (Bootstrap) in a Single Page Application.

### **Software Requirements**
- Node.js  
- React  
- Bootstrap  
- Web Browser  

### **Theory**
Bootstrap is a popular CSS-based component library that provides pre-built UI components such as buttons, cards, forms, and navigation bars. It helps developers build responsive and consistent user interfaces quickly.

### **Procedure**
1. Create a React application.
2. Install Bootstrap using npm.
3. Import Bootstrap CSS into the project.
4. Design UI using Bootstrap components.
5. Run and observe the application.
